# Customizing & Extending the Platform

Extend your Magic platform experience by creating custom workflows, integrating new AI models, developing tool nodes or agents, and addressing complex edge-case integration scenarios. This page provides valuable tips, practical guidance, and answers to the most common questions encountered when tailoring Magic to unique enterprise needs.

---

## 1. Getting Started with Custom Workflows

### What are Custom Workflows?
Custom workflows enable you to design AI-driven processes beyond the default templates. They allow you to automate complex tasks by chaining logic and interactions among AI agents, knowledge bases, and messaging platforms.

### How do I create a custom workflow?
- Use Magic Flow’s visual designer to drag and drop nodes.
- Configure nodes with your required AI models, tools, or custom inputs.
- Deploy and test workflows iteratively to validate behavior.

<Tip>
Start small with simple condition branches and incrementally add nodes to manage complexity gracefully.
</Tip>

### Can I reuse components across workflows?
Yes, you can create reusable nodes or subflows (if supported) to modularize and organize your processes for maintainability.

## 2. Integrating New AI Models

### How do I connect a custom or third-party LLM to Magic?
- Securely manage API keys and endpoints using environment variables.
- Configure the AI model integration within Magic’s SDK or workflow nodes.
- Use the Custom LLM Integration guide for detailed setup steps.

### What are common pitfalls when integrating new models?
- Inconsistent API request or response formats.
- Improper key or token management causing authentication failures.
- Latency issues affecting workflow responsiveness.

<Warning>
Test integrations in isolated environments before production deployment to catch configuration or performance problems early.
</Warning>

## 3. Developing Custom Tool Nodes and Plugins

### What is a Tool Node?
A Tool Node is a specialized workflow element that executes custom logic or integrates external services as part of your automation.

### How do I build a custom Tool Node?
1. Define your tool’s logic in code, ensuring clear input/output interfaces.
2. Register the tool with Magic’s extension system.
3. Add the tool node to your workflow palette for drag-and-drop usage.

### How can custom plugins interact with the Magic event system?
Plugins can listen for platform events (such as workflow triggers or messaging events) to automate reactions or notifications.

<Steps>
<Step title="Develop Your Tool Logic">
Use language and frameworks compatible with your deployment environment.
</Step>
<Step title="Register the Tool">
Follow platform-specific registration processes to make your tool discoverable.
</Step>
<Step title="Test and Deploy">
Validate tool behavior within sample workflows before wider adoption.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Best practices
- Use meaningful node and parameter names.
- Handle exceptions cleanly to avoid disrupting workflows.
- Document tool functionality and usage examples.

---

## 4. Extending AI Agents

### How do I customize AI agents?
- Tailor system instructions and model prompts.
- Add specific use cases or predefined Q&A pairs.
- Deploy updated models via the AI agent configuration panel.

### Can AI agents call my custom tools or APIs?
Yes, through the event-driven extensibility system or workflow orchestration, agents can trigger custom nodes or external API calls.

---

## 5. Handling Edge-Case Integration Issues

### What should I do if my custom extension fails intermittently?
- Verify configuration parameters and authentication credentials.
- Review logs for timeout, rate limiting, or permission errors.
- Enable verbose logging during testing to gather diagnostic details.

### How to debug complex failures?
- Use step-by-step workflow execution monitoring to isolate failure points.
- Identify whether failures are caused by input validation, external API responses, or internal exceptions.
- Collaborate with platform support and reference SDK error handling documentation.

### Common integration pitfalls
- Missing or expired tokens causing unauthorized errors.
- Invalid input parameters rejected by APIs (see InvalidParameterException usage).
- Incorrect message formatting resulting in send failures.

<AccordionGroup title="Common Error Scenarios & Diagnostics">
<Accordion title="Invalid Parameter Errors">
This error means some required parameters are incorrect or missing. Double-check inputs against API specifications and validate before requests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Bad Request Responses">
Indicates API rejection likely due to malformed data or authentication issues. Review request payloads and access tokens.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="File Download Failures">
Verify download codes and token validity. Network issues or permission denials may also cause failures.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Always manage sensitive credentials securely using Magic’s environment variable configuration.
- Use SDKs for consistent API integration and error handling.
- Implement retries with exponential backoff to handle transient failures.
- Leverage the event-driven architecture for reactive and extensible workflows.
- Regularly update custom components to stay compatible with platform upgrades.

<Note>
Consult the Custom Tools and Event-Driven Extensibility guides for deeper insights into advanced customization capabilities.

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Workflow node fails validation/error
- Check the node’s input parameters are correctly set.
- Review error logs for exceptions like `InvalidParameterException`.
- Ensure all required fields follow API or SDK rules.

### Issue: Messages not sent from custom bots
- Validate your robot access tokens and app credentials.
- Confirm message payload formats comply with the platform's requirements.
- Check API rate limits and throttling configurations.

### Issue: Download file API returns error
- Make sure `downloadCode` and `robotCode` are valid and not expired.
- Verify network accessibility and endpoint reachability.
- Check for permission or access control restrictions.

### Debugging Steps
<Steps>
<Step title="Enable Detailed Logging">
Activate verbose logs in your SDK client or workflow monitor.
</Step>
<Step title="Reproduce the Error with Sample Data">
Use test inputs to isolate the problem scope.
</Step>
<Step title="Validate Tokens and Credentials">
Confirm all tokens are fresh and correctly scoped.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 9. Example: Sending a One-on-One Chat Message Using SDK Endpoint

```php
use Dtyq\EasyDingTalk\OpenDev\Endpoint\ChatBot\ChatBotEndpoint;
use Dtyq\EasyDingTalk\OpenDev\Parameter\ChatBot\SendOneOnOneChatMessagesParameter;

$endpoint = new ChatBotEndpoint();

$param = new SendOneOnOneChatMessagesParameter();
$param->setAccessToken('your-access-token');
$param->setRobotCode('your-robot-code');
$param->setUserIds(['user-id-1']);
$param->setMsgKey('text');
$param->setMsgParam(['content' => 'Hello from custom workflow!']);

try {
    $result = $endpoint->sendOneOnOneChatMessages($param);
    echo "Message sent: Process Query Key = ", $result->getProcessQueryKey();
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Error sending message: ", $e->getMessage();
}
```

## 10. Example: Handling Parameter Validation Error

```php
use Dtyq\EasyDingTalk\Kernel\Exceptions\InvalidParameterException;

try {
    // Assume $param is missing required fields
    $param->validate();
} catch (InvalidParameterException $e) {
    echo 'Parameter validation failed: ', $e->getMessage();
    // Log or adjust parameters accordingly
}
```
