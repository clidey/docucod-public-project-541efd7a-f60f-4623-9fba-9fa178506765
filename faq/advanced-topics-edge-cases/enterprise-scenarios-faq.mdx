# Enterprise Deployment & Advanced Configuration

This page guides enterprises and IT administrators through advanced deployment scenarios of the Magic platform. It explains how to handle multi-organization data isolation, integrate custom authentication methods, establish high-availability setups, and implement best practices for scaling and securing Magic in large-scale environments.

---

## 1. Multi-Organization Data Separation

Magic is designed to securely support multiple organizations within a single deployment while strictly isolating data and resources. This ensures each organization's dataset, users, workflows, and secrets remain private and compliant with enterprise policies.

### Key Concepts
- **Tenant Isolation:** Each organization operates in a logically isolated context, preventing cross-organization data visibility.
- **Scoped Access Control:** Permissions and API access tokens are scoped per-organization, enforcing boundary protections.
- **Organization-Aware APIs:** All interactions must include organization identifiers to ensure proper separation.

### User Workflow for Multi-Org Usage
1. **Register and Define Organizations:** Admins create organization entities representing their business units or tenant customers.
2. **Assign Users to Organizations:** Users are scoped into organizations with roles and access permissions.
3. **Configure Organization-Specific Resources:** Knowledge bases, AI agents, workflows, and messaging connections are segmented per organization.
4. **Operate with Context:** API calls and UI sessions operate under the organization context, preventing data leaks.

### Best Practices
- Enforce strict authentication tokens tied to organizational scopes.
- Use role-based access controls (RBAC) within organizations.
- Regularly audit tenant boundaries to detect and prevent cross-tenant access.
- Refer to the [Multi-Organization and Tenant Isolation guide](/security/authentication-and-access/multi-organization-and-tenant-isolation) for detailed implementation models.

## 2. Custom Authentication Integrations

For enterprises with specialized identity management systems, Magic supports custom authentication adapters to integrate with existing SSO, OAuth providers, or API key management.

### Common Use Cases
- Integrating with corporate SAML or OAuth providers.
- Using API keys or tokens issued by enterprise security gateways.
- Leveraging Easy DingTalk SDK tokens for DingTalk enterprise account authentication.

### Integration Approach
- **Configure Authentication Endpoints:** Customize environment variables and config files to point to enterprise identity providers.
- **Token Management:** Magic leverages caching and token rotation to maintain session security.
- **SDK Support:** Use Magic SDKs with built-in support for common authentication schemes; extend SDKs for custom flows.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Verify token scope and expiry periods match the organizational policy.
- Ensure tokens include necessary claims to enforce tenant isolation.
- Consult the [Authentication Methods guide](/security/authentication-and-access/authentication-methods) and the [SDK Authentication & Credential Management](/sdks/configuration-auth/authentication-methods) documentation.

## 3. High Availability and Scaling Strategies

Enterprise demands require a deployment that is fault-tolerant, scalable, and manageable at large user volumes.

### Deployment Patterns
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Deploy multiple service instances behind load balancers to distribute workload.
- **Stateless Services:** Ensure core services do not store ephemeral data locally to allow easy scaling.
- **Stateful Components:** Use external databases, queues (e.g., RabbitMQ), and vector stores supporting clustering.

### Recommended Practices
- Use the [Scaling & High Availability guide](/deployment/scaling-monitoring-and-resilience/scaling-and-high-availability) for step-by-step instructions on multi-node deployments.
- Monitor resource usage with centralized logging and metrics as explained in [Monitoring & Logging Overview](/deployment/scaling-monitoring-and-resilience/monitoring-and-logging-overview).
- Enable autoscaling policies in cloud environments or use Kubernetes for container orchestration.

### Workflow Resilience
- Use retry and timeout configurations in workflows to handle service interruptions gracefully.
- Employ caching layers to reduce load on backends.

## 4. Best Practices for Enterprise Deployments

### Security Hardening
- Manage secrets securely using encrypted environment variables and Docker/Kubernetes secrets ([Runtime Hardening & Secrets Management](/deployment/security-hardening-and-compliance/runtime-hardening-and-secrets-management)).
- Enforce principle of least privilege in API keys and SDK credentials.
- Restrict network exposures with firewall and reverse proxy configurations ([Network Exposure & Access Control](/deployment/security-hardening-and-compliance/network-exposure-and-access-control)).

### Configuration Management
- Organize `.env` files per environment and use version control to track changes ([Managing Configuration Across Environments](/guides/best-practices-optimization/system-config-management)).
- Apply safe update strategies to avoid downtime.

### Integration Considerations
- Follow documented procedures for integrating with third-party messaging platforms and knowledge bases ([Third-Party Messaging Integration](/guides/advanced-customization-integration/third-party-messaging-integration)).
- Test custom tools and LLM connectors in isolated staging before production rollout.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Enterprise Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Enterprise Deployment Questions">
<Accordion title="How do I ensure organizations cannot access each other's data?">
Use built-in tenant isolation features; always attach the organization context to user sessions and API requests to enforce strict boundaries. Audit access logs regularly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I integrate corporate SSO with Magic login?">
Yes, you can customize authentication layers and use token-based methods to integrate corporate SSO providers. Refer to the Authentication Methods and SDK Authentication guides.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What are best practices for scaling Magic at enterprise scale?">
Deploy multiple service instances, externalize state management, monitor actively, and use container orchestration or cloud autoscaling features as detailed in the Scaling & High Availability guide.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I securely manage secrets in production?">
Use encrypted environment variables and secret managers like Docker secrets or Vault. Avoid embedding secrets in code or public repositories. See Runtime Hardening & Secrets Management.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I monitor and troubleshoot performance at scale?">
Enable centralized logging, metrics collection, and tracing as described in Monitoring & Logging Overview and Workflow Performance Tuning guides.

## 6. Example: Configuring Multi-Org Access Token Retrieval

Using the Magic Easy DingTalk SDK as an example, tokens are retrieved and cached per organization to securely manage access.

```php
// Select configuration for a specific organization or app
$openDev = new OpenDevFactory();
$openDev->accessTokenEndpoint->selectApp('organizationA');

// Retrieve access token scoped to the organization
$accessToken = $openDev->accessTokenEndpoint->get();

// Use the token in subsequent API calls
$userList = $openDev->departmentEndpoint->getSub(new GetSubParameter($accessToken));
```

This pattern ensures each organization uses its own credentials and tokens, maintaining strict separation.
