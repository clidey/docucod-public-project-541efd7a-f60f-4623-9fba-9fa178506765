# Installation Guide

Welcome to the Magic Installation Guide. This page helps you get your Magic AI productivity platform up and running quickly using Docker. Follow the step-by-step instructions to clone the repository, start the services, and access the system for the first time.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Preparation

### System Requirements
- Operating System: Linux, macOS, or Windows (with Docker support)
- Docker: Install the latest stable [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) engine
- Docker Compose: Ensure Docker Compose is installed ([Docker Compose Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/))
- Minimum Hardware:
  - CPU: 4 cores recommended
  - Memory: At least 8 GB RAM
  - Disk Space: Minimum 10 GB free

### Network & Permissions
- Ensure Docker has permission to bind required ports (default ports used by Magic)
- Allow outbound internet access for package downloads
- No special firewall rules needed initially for local testing

<Tip>
It is highly recommended to review the full [System Requirements](/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/system-requirements) page before proceeding to guarantee a smooth installation.

## 2. Installation Instructions

This installation uses Docker for quick deployment and easier service management.

### Step 1: Clone the Magic GitHub Repository

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dtyq/magic.git
cd magic
```

You will have the latest Magic source code locally.

### Step 2: Pull Required Docker Images

Run the following to download and assemble necessary images:

```bash
docker-compose pull
```

### Step 3: Start Magic Services in Foreground

To run Magic interactively (stop with Ctrl+C):

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This launches the backend API, database, and web UI.

### Step 4: Running as Background Service

For long-running deployments, start services detached:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To stop the services:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Step 5: Verify Services Are Running

Check running containers:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

Expected services:
- magic-api
- magic-web
- magic-db

Successful output should indicate all services are 'Up'.

<Tip>
If containers fail to start, inspect logs with

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

and resolve any errors.
</Tip>

## 3. Accessing Magic

### Step 1: Open the Web UI

In your web browser, navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

You should see the Magic login screen.

### Step 2: First Login

- Use a Magic-provided or configured admin account to login
- For Cloud or Community editions, please refer to the respective login or onboarding flows

<Tip>
Refer to the [First Start & Accessing Magic](/getting-started/configuration-initial-setup/first-start-and-login) guide for detailed user onboarding.
</Tip>

## 4. Basic Operational Commands

Once installed, you will commonly need to manage the Magic services. Here are essential Docker Compose commands:

| Command                     | Purpose                            |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `docker-compose up -d`       | Start all services in the background |
| `docker-compose down`        | Stop and remove containers       |
| `docker-compose restart`     | Restart all services              |
| `docker-compose logs -f`     | View real-time logs               |

<Tip>
Running services in detached mode (`-d`) helps keep your terminal free while Magic runs as a background service.
</Tip>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem: Containers do not start
- **Check logs:** Run `docker-compose logs -f` to identify errors.
- **Port conflicts:** Ensure ports 8080 (web UI) and related are free on the host.
- **Resource constraints:** Verify your system meets minimum CPU/memory requirements.

### Problem: Unable to access the UI
- Confirm that Docker containers are running.
- Check if your firewall blocks port 8080.
- If running on a remote server, confirm port forwarding or proxy configuration.

### Problem: Repository clone is slow or fails
- Use a stable internet connection.
- For faster cloning, consider using a mirror or shallow clone:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/dtyq/magic.git
```

<Tip>
For detailed troubleshooting advice, see the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](/getting-started/validation-troubleshooting/common-setup-issues) page.
