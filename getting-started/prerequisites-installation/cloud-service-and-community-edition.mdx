# Cloud Service vs Community Edition

Magic empowers users with two distinct deployment options: the official Magic Cloud Service and the self-hosted open-source Community Edition. Understanding their differences will help you pick the best approach aligned with your technical capacity, control needs, and operational goals.

## 1. Overview: Choosing Your Deployment Mode

Magic's **Cloud Service** offers a managed, streamlined experience with minimal setup, automatic updates, and integrated support. The **Community Edition** is fully open-source, allowing complete control over customization, deployment, and data sovereignty at the cost of managing infrastructure yourself.

This page guides you through the key distinctions, benefits, and onboarding paths for each.

## 7. Practical Tips

- **Trial First**: Consider testing Magic Cloud Service before committing to self-hosting to experience the platform without operational overhead.
- **Plan for Scale**: Self-hosting gives flexibility but requires infrastructure planning; use container orchestration like Kubernetes for production.
- **Keep Updated**: Community Edition depends on your team ensuring timely updates, particularly security patches.
- **Leverage Community**: Engage with the open-source community on GitHub for support, contributions, and shared knowledge.
