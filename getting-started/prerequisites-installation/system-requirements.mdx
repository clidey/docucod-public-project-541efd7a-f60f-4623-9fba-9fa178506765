# System Requirements for Magic Deployment

Welcome to the System Requirements page. Here you'll find everything you need to prepare your environment for a successful Magic deployment. Whether you're setting up on a local machine or a cloud server, this guide walks you through the essential hardware, software, and permission prerequisites.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems
Magic supports deployment on the following operating systems:

- **Linux** (preferred for production environments)
- **macOS** (ideal for local development and testing)
- **Windows 10 and later** (via WSL 2 or native Docker Desktop)

> **Tip:** For production, Linux distributions like Ubuntu 20.04+ or CentOS 8+ provide the best compatibility.

---

## 2. Hardware Requirements
To ensure smooth operation, your environment should meet the following minimum hardware specifications:

| Resource       | Minimum          | Recommended     |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| CPU            | 2 cores          | 4+ cores        |
| RAM            | 4 GB             | 8+ GB           |
| Storage        | 20 GB free space | 50+ GB SSD      |
| Network        | Stable broadband | Gigabit Ethernet|

> **Note:** Heavy AI workloads and multi-agent orchestration can benefit significantly from additional RAM and faster CPUs.

---

## 3. Required Software Dependencies
Magic relies on containerization to streamline installation and isolation. Ensure the following software and versions are installed and configured:

- **Docker:** 
  - Minimum version: 20.10
  - Recommended: Latest stable release
- **Docker Compose:**
  - Minimum version: 1.29
  - Recommended: Latest stable release supporting Compose v2 syntax

> **Important:** Docker must be properly configured with adequate permissions (e.g., user belongs to `docker` group on Linux).

> **Tip:** Verify Docker Compose version by running `docker-compose --version`.

### Installing Docker & Docker Compose

- On **Linux** (Ubuntu example):

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose
  sudo systemctl start docker
  sudo systemctl enable docker
  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
  newgrp docker
  ```

- On **macOS** and **Windows**:

  Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and enable the WSL 2 integration on Windows.

---

## 4. Network and Permissions

Ensure your environment allows the following:

- Outbound HTTPS access for downloading base images and libraries
- Open Docker daemon port (default: Unix socket or TCP as configured)
- Firewall rules permitting container traffic internally

<Warning>
Improper Docker permissions or restrictive firewalls can cause deployment failures. Confirm your user has Docker access and networking permits container communication.
</Warning>

---

## 5. User Account and Access Rights

- Administrator/root access during installation to configure Docker and system-level dependencies
- SSH or remote access to cloud or server environments
- Ability to modify environment variables and system configurations if needed

---

## 6. Verifying Your Environment

After setup, verify your environment before proceeding:

### Step 1: Check Docker version
```bash
docker --version
```
Expected output: `Docker version 20.10.x, build ...`

### Step 2: Check Docker Compose version
```bash
docker-compose --version
```
Expected output: `docker-compose version 1.29.x, build ...`

### Step 3: Test Docker run
```bash
docker run hello-world
```
You should see a message confirming Docker can run and pull containers.

<Check>
If you encounter permission denied errors, ensure your user is part of the Docker group or run commands with `sudo`.
</Check>

---

## 7. Summary Checklist
- Operating system supported and up to date
- Hardware meets minimum specs
- Docker (>= 20.10) and Docker Compose installed
- User permissions configured for Docker
- Network settings allow container image download and internal communication

---

## 8. Troubleshooting Common System Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting System Preparation">
<Accordion title="Docker installation fails or commands not found">
- Verify installation steps for your OS
- Ensure `$PATH` includes Docker binaries
- Restart your terminal or system after installation
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission denied when running Docker commands">
- Add your user to the `docker` group:

  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
  newgrp docker
  ```

- Alternatively, prepend commands with `sudo`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Firewall or proxy blocking Docker image downloads">
- Ensure outbound HTTPS (port 443) is open
- Configure proxy settings for Docker if behind corporate proxy
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 9. Next Steps
With your system prepared, proceed to the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/installation-guide) to deploy Magic. 

For configuring advanced environment variables, see [Environment Variables](/getting-started/configuration-initial-setup/environment-variables).

If you encounter issues, consult [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](/getting-started/validation-troubleshooting/common-setup-issues) or reach out via our support channels.
