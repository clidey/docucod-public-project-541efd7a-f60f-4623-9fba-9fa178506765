# Quick Validation Steps

Ensure your Magic platform deployment is fully operational before team-wide adoption. This guide walks you through essential validation procedures, including checking service endpoints, accessing the web user interface, testing API responses, and monitoring RabbitMQ status to confirm the systemâ€™s functionality.

---

## 1. Verify Core Service Endpoints

Confirm that all essential backend services are running and accessible.

### Steps

1. **Check MCP Service Status**
   - Access the MCP Service health endpoint via the URL:
     ```
     http://<your-server-address>:<mcp-port>/health
     ```
   - A successful response indicates the MCP service is up and running.
   
2. **Confirm API Availability**
   - Test the Magic API endpoint:
     ```
     http://<your-server-address>:<api-port>/api/v1/status
     ```
   - Expect a JSON response indicating the API is responsive.

3. **Test the Communication with RabbitMQ**
   - Ensure RabbitMQ is connected and operational:
     - Log into RabbitMQ management UI (usually at `http://<server>:15672`)
     - Check the connection status and queues related to Magic.

<Tip>
Ensure your firewall settings allow traffic on all Magic service ports, including web UI, API ports, and RabbitMQ management ports.
</Tip>

## 2. Access the Web User Interface (Web UI)

Validate that the Magic Web UI loads correctly and is responsive.

### Steps

1. Open your web browser.
2. Navigate to the Magic Web UI URL:
   ```
   http://<your-server-address>:<web-ui-port>/
   ```
3. Ensure the login page loads without errors.
4. Use your credentials to log in.
5. Confirm that the dashboard or landing page appears and interactive elements respond.

<Note>
If the UI fails to load or login is unsuccessful, verify the web server configuration and that all necessary services are running.
</Note>

## 3. Test API with Basic Requests

Verify the API responds correctly to requests.

### Steps

1. Use a tool such as `curl` or Postman.
2. Send a GET request to a simple API endpoint, for example, to list agents or flows:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://<your-server-address>:<api-port>/api/v1/agents
   ```
3. Confirm you get a valid JSON response with agent information.

<Info>
Authentication may be required. Use appropriate headers or tokens as configured.
</Info>

## 4. Check RabbitMQ Status

RabbitMQ is critical for messaging and workflow orchestration. Confirm it is operational.

### Steps

1. Access the RabbitMQ Management Interface (default port 15672):
   ```
   http://<your-server-address>:15672
   ```
2. Log in with RabbitMQ credentials.
3. Verify the following:
   - Connection count is as expected (Magic services connected).
   - Key queues exist and have no unexpected backlogs.
   - No critical errors or alarms are present.

<Tip>
If the RabbitMQ UI is inaccessible, ensure RabbitMQ is running and not blocked by firewall or network policies.
</Tip>
