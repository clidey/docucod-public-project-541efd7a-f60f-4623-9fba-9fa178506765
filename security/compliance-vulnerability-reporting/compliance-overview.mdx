# Compliance Requirements and Data Governance

Ensure your deployment of Magic aligns with key regulatory standards and governance policies by understanding critical data handling practices, audit features, and customizable controls. This guide empowers administrators and compliance officers to confidently manage user data, privacy controls, and data residency, addressing GDPR and other regulatory requirements.

---

## 1. Data Handling Practices

### Data Classification and Segregation
Magic organizes data systematically to enforce strict separation between organizations, projects, and users. Sensitive data, such as user credentials and messages, are classified for appropriate treatment.

- **User Data:** Personal identifiable information (PII) including names, emails, and access credentials.
- **Message Content:** Conversation logs, including AI interactions, are stored with encryption.
- **Attachments and Knowledge Documents:** Managed via encrypted storage drivers with configurable retention.

### Secure Storage and Encryption
All critical data is protected both at rest and in transit with strong encryption:

- **Encryption At Rest:** Databases and file storage systems use encryption keys managed securely.
- **Encryption In Transit:** TLS/HTTPS protocols protect API interactions and data exchange.

### Data Retention and Deletion
Magic supports customizable retention policies governed by organizational settings:

- **Automatic Cleanup:** Messages and documents can be configured for automatic purging after configurable periods to meet compliance.
- **User and Account Deletion:** Secure workflows ensure permanent removal of user data upon request.

<Tip>
Define and regularly review retention policies in line with your organization's regulatory obligations. Use Magic's administrative tools to automate data lifecycle management.
</Tip>

## 2. Audit Features

Magic implements comprehensive audit logging to provide a traceable and tamper-evident record of actions across the platform.

### What is Audited?
- **User Access and Authentication:** All login attempts and token exchanges.
- **Configuration Changes:** Modifications to organization, permission settings, and integrations.
- **Workflow and AI Agent Activity:** Creation, updates, and execution logs.
- **Message and Data Access:** Records of data retrieval or modifications, including knowledge base usage.

### Audit Log Access and Management
- Audit logs are accessible through secure administrative portals with role-based access controls.
- Logs are immutable and retained to support forensic investigations or compliance audits.

### Compliance Support
Audit trails satisfy requirements for GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulatory frameworks by providing evidence of proper data governance.

<Warning>
Ensure that audit log storage complies with data residency mandates; configure your platform to align with local jurisdictional policies.
</Warning>

## 3. Customizable Controls for Regulatory Compliance

Magic supports flexible configuration to adapt to diverse regulatory mandates such as GDPR and others.

### Data Residency
- You can configure the geographical location of data storage to comply with regional data residency requirements.
- Supported file drivers allow integration with cloud storage providers meeting local regulations.

### Privacy Controls
- **Data Access Policies:** Role-based access control (RBAC) limits data exposure within your organization.
- **Consent and User Rights:** Support for user requests on data access, deletion, and rectification.

### Legal Hold and Archiving
- Configure retention overrides for legal hold situations to suspend deletion of certain records.

### Configuration Example
Administrators can customize compliance settings via environment variables and configuration files:

```env
# Example: Enable GDPR compliance features
MAGIC_GDPR_COMPLIANCE_ENABLED=true

# Set data retention period (in days)
MAGIC_DATA_RETENTION_DAYS=365

# Define storage region
MAGIC_STORAGE_REGION=eu-central-1
```

<Note>
Refer to the Environment Variables Configuration guide for detailed settings available to support compliance.
</Note>

## 4. Operational Considerations in Regulated Environments

### Access Control Alignment
Combine compliance controls with Magic’s authentication and authorization models to enforce strict role assignments and tenant isolation.

### Secure API Usage
Use encrypted communication channels and token validation to protect data exchanges and audit API calls.

### Integration Governance
When connecting external integrations like messaging platforms or cloud services, enforce compliance by vetting third-party providers and managing credentials securely.

### Incident Reporting and Response
Establish clear incident response procedures, including breach notifications as required by applicable law.

## 5. Recommended Practices

- **Regular Compliance Audits:** Leverage Magic’s audit logs and reporting to conduct periodic reviews.
- **Least Privilege Principle:** Limit user and system permissions to the minimum required.
- **Data Minimization:** Retain only necessary data, deleting obsolete records promptly.
- **Documentation:** Record your compliance configurations and policies clearly for audit readiness.

<Check>
Keep your Magic deployment updated with the latest security patches and compliance-related features.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Compliance Issues

### Problem: Missing Audit Logs
- Verify audit logging is enabled and properly configured.
- Check role permissions for audit log access.

### Problem: Data Retention Not Enforced
- Confirm retention periods are set correctly.
- Check for legal hold configurations that may override retention.

### Problem: Data Residency Non-Compliance
- Review file storage and database region settings.
- Migrate data if necessary to compliant regions.

For detailed troubleshooting, see the Security Hardening and Updates and Secure Deployment guides.
