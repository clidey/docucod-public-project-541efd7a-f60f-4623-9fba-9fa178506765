# Breaking Changes & Deprecations

This page documents significant backward-incompatible changes, deprecated features, and removed APIs introduced in Magic platform's updates. It is essential for users planning upgrades or maintaining existing integrations to review this information carefully. Understanding these alterations guarantees smooth transitions and uninterrupted usage of Magicâ€™s ecosystem.

## Understanding Breaking Changes

Breaking changes are modifications that prevent previous functionalities from working without adjustment. These may include changes in data formats, removed or altered API endpoints, or shifts in workflow behavior. Identifying and adapting to these changes early ensures your environment remains stable and your integrations continue to operate as expected.

### What Users Need to Do:

- **Review each breaking change carefully**: Confirm if your current usage is affected.
- **Follow migration instructions** where provided to update your workflows or code.
- **Test in staging environments** before applying changes in production.

## Deprecated Features and APIs

Deprecation signals that a feature or API is planned for removal in a future release. While still available, deprecated items should be phased out promptly to avoid sudden disruptions.

### Recommended Best Practices:

- Identify use of deprecated features in your projects.
- Replace deprecated APIs with the supported alternatives as soon as possible.
- Monitor deprecation timelines outlined in the upgrade guides.

## Recent Breaking Changes and Deprecations by Version

### Version 3.2.0 (Released 2024-05-15)
- **Removal of legacy flow node types:** Older node types, such as "single-debug" nodes, have been removed. Users must update workflows to adopt the supported node types detailed in the [Workflow Orchestration Guide](https://docs.magic.com/guides/getting-started/workflow-orchestration).
- **Strict validation on flow JSON schema:** Start nodes now enforce additional validation rules for trigger types and input keys, requiring updates to existing flows to comply with new JSON schema standards.
- **Deprecated flow entity property:** The `flow_entity` attribute is deprecated and will be removed in 4.0. Migrate references to the new `flow_code` property.

### Version 3.1.5 (Released 2024-03-10)
- **API parameter changes in flow execution endpoints:** Some parameters related to node execution and branching have changed to enhance consistency. See [Flow CRUD API](https://docs.magic.com/api-reference/workflow-automation/flow-crud) for updated request formats.
- **Model embedding configuration revamped:** Embedding configuration errors now return explicit `embedding_failed` messages. Users must ensure embedding parameters match updated specifications.

### Version 3.0.0 (Released 2024-01-05)
- **Breaking changes to agent interaction commands:** Interaction command structures were revised. Existing custom commands require redefinition following the updated interaction command schema.
- **Deprecated message types:** Certain message types unsupported in streaming scenarios are no longer accepted. Please consult the [Magic IM Setup Guide](https://docs.magic.com/guides/getting-started/ai-im-setup) for compatible message formats.
- **Removed default editing permission for tool sets:** Editing the default tool set is now prohibited to prevent accidental disruption. Define custom tool sets for modifications.
