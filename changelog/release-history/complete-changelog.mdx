## Understanding the Changelog

The Full Changelog documents each release in detail, focusing exclusively on user-visible changes. It provides insights into:

- **Release Dates:** When each version became available.
- **New Features:** Functional additions and key capabilities introduced.
- **Improvements:** Enhancements to existing features that optimize user experience.
- **Bug Fixes:** Issues resolved to increase stability and reliability.

This ensures users grasp not only what changed, but why it matters from their perspective.

## Versioning and Release Cadence

Magic follows the semantic versioning format `x.y.z` as detailed in the [Version Description](https://github.com/dtyq/magic/blob/main/docs/en/development/version/versions.md). Here's a quick refresher:

- **x (Major):** Significant platform refactors or breaking API/UI changes.
- **y (Minor):** Major feature iterations with possible backward-incompatible API/UI updates.
- **z (Patch):** Bug fixes, security updates, and minor features with full backward compatibility.

The platform adopts an agile weekly release cycle, publishing new versions every Monday (UTC+08:00), mostly patch (z) and feature iteration (y) releases.

Users should refer to the corresponding upgrade guides for major (x) and minor (y) versions to ensure smooth transitions.
