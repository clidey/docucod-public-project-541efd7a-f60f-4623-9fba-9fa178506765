## Custom Tool Integration

Magic’s extensible architecture empowers you to add your own custom tools and plugins, enabling tailored logic and capabilities within AI workflows.

### Why Integrate Custom Tools?

- Add proprietary business logic or integrations not covered by default SDK features.
- Automate unique workflows or data transformations specific to your organization.
- Embed external APIs or services as callable nodes within Magic Flow.

### Getting Started

1. **Define Your Tool Logic:** Implement your tool’s functionality as a discrete module or service.
2. **Register the Tool Node:** Add it to Magic’s workflow palette for drag-and-drop usage.
3. **Hook Into Events:** Use event listeners to trigger tool execution or monitor outcomes.

### Best Practices

- Keep each tool focused on a single responsibility to simplify maintenance.
- Handle errors proactively and report detailed context for debugging.
- Document your tool’s input-output schema for clear usage.

<Note>
Carefully consider performance impacts; batch or asynchronous processing is recommended for heavy or long-running tasks.
</Note>

## Workflow Customization and Extension

Customizing workflows is key to tailoring Magic Flow to complex business scenarios.

### Extending Default Workflow Nodes

- Override or extend existing nodes with additional validation or custom data handling.
- Add conditional logic to branch flows dynamically beyond standard node capability.

### Creating Composite Workflows

Leverage node groups and reusable subflows to encapsulate common patterns.

### Example Scenario

Imagine extending the approval workflow to include a third-party compliance check that triggers only for high-risk submissions.

### Tips

- Use descriptive node names and metadata.
- Test workflows end-to-end with realistic data.
- Track execution logs for insights.

---

## Batch Operations and Bulk Processing

Efficient handling of multiple items or high volume data is critical at scale.

### Using Batch APIs

Leverage batch endpoints (e.g., bulk sending messages or mass updating documents) to reduce network overhead and improve performance.

### Implementing Batch Logic in SDK

- Group operations logically to avoid partial failures.
- Incorporate retry and backoff strategies for transient errors.

### Example: Batch Sending Chat Messages

```php
use Dtyq\EasyDingTalk\OpenDevFactory;
use Dtyq\EasyDingTalk\OpenDev\Parameter\ChatBot\SendOneOnOneChatMessagesParameter;

$factory = new OpenDevFactory([
  'app_key' => 'your_app_key',
  'app_secret' => 'your_app_secret',
]);

$accessToken = $factory->accessTokenEndpoint->getAccessToken();

$param = new SendOneOnOneChatMessagesParameter($accessToken);
$param->setRobotCode('your_robot_code');
$param->setUserIds(['user1', 'user2', 'user3']);
$param->setMsgKey('sampleMarkdown');
$param->setMsgParam(json_encode([ 'title' => 'Batch Message', 'text' => 'Hello everyone!' ]));

$result = $factory->chatBotEndpoint->sendOneOnOneChatMessages($param);

// Check $result for success
```

<Info>
Batch operations reduce API calls and latency. Always validate responses to handle partial failures.
</Info>

## Implementing Organization-Wide Policies

To enforce consistency and security, Magic enables organization-wide controls through SDK customization.

### Policy Enforcement Points

- **Authentication and Token Management:** Leverage centralized access tokens and role-based scopes.
- **API Request Validation:** Override endpoint methods to include policy checks.
- **Workflow Restrictions:** Apply rules preventing unauthorized node usage or data exposure.

### Practical Example

Inject validation logic in SDK layers to check user roles before allowing message dispatch or sensitive data access.

### Recommendations

- Use environment variables and configuration files for flexible policy toggling.
- Centralize policy logic to reduce duplication.

---

## Extending Core SDK Classes

The SDK is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing you to subclass and modify core components.

### Why Extend?

- Customize request headers or retry logic.
- Add custom logging or telemetry.
- Modify parameter validation or result processing.

### How to Extend

1. Identify the SDK class to extend (e.g., `ChatBotEndpoint`).
2. Override methods with your custom behavior.
3. Use your subclass in place of the original in your application.

### Example

```php
class CustomChatBotEndpoint extends \Dtyq\EasyDingTalk\OpenDev\Endpoint\ChatBot\ChatBotEndpoint
{
    public function sendGroupMessage(SendGroupMessageParameter $parameter): SendGroupMessageResult
    {
        // Add custom logging before sending
        error_log('Sending group message to conversation: ' . $parameter->getOpenConversationId());
        return parent::sendGroupMessage($parameter);
    }
}
```

## Interfacing with Other Magic Products

Magic’s modular ecosystem encourages integration across products for maximum business impact.

### Examples

- Use Magic Flow’s orchestration with Magic IM’s chat bots for contextual notifications.
- Connect knowledge search features to AI agents for enriched conversations.
- Automate document updates via workflow nodes triggered by chat events.

### Integration Workflow

- Authenticate consistently using centralized token management.
- Use SDK endpoints cohesively, passing contextual data between modules.

---

## Troubleshooting Advanced Usage

### Common Issues

- **Token Expiration:** Ensure your extended classes refresh tokens appropriately.
- **Partial Batch Failures:** Implement retry logic and error aggregation.
- **Custom Tool Node Failures:** Log errors and validate input/output schemas rigorously.

### Recommendations

- Enable verbose SDK logging during development.
- Keep dependencies updated for compatibility.
- Consult Magic’s event and error handling docs for troubleshooting.

## Summary

Advanced usage and extensibility unlock Magic’s full potential by adapting it precisely to your organization's unique needs. By integrating custom tools, customizing workflows, efficiently handling batch operations, enforcing organization-wide policies, and extending SDK components, you create tailored, scalable, and maintainable solutions that leverage all Magic products harmoniously.
