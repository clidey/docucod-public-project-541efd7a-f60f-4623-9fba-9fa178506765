# Installation & Basic Setup

Welcome to the starting point for integrating Magic's SDKs into your projects. This guide provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for installing each supported SDK, setting up your development environment, and quickly bootstrapping a new project. Whether you are a PHP, TypeScript, or Python developer, you'll find clear commands, configuration tips, and minimal code examples to get you up and running fast.

---

## 1. Prerequisites and Environment Setup

Before installing any SDK, ensure your development environment meets the following prerequisites:

- **Supported Platforms:** Verify your operating system and architecture are compatible with the SDK's target environment.
- **Language Versions:**
  - PHP: 8.1+ (required for Easy DingTalk SDK)
  - Python: Latest stable version recommended
  - TypeScript/JavaScript: Node.js version 14 or later
- **Package Managers Installed:** Composer for PHP, npm/yarn for TypeScript, pip for Python
- **Network Access:** Ensure outbound access to public package repositories and Magic's API endpoints.

Take a moment to verify these prerequisites to avoid common installation pitfalls.

## 2. Installing Magic SDKs

Magic provides officially supported SDKs in PHP, TypeScript, and Python. Each SDK is distributed via popular package managers for ease of installation.

### 2.1 PHP SDK Installation

Use Composer to install Magic PHP SDKs, including integrations like Easy DingTalk.

```bash
composer require dtyq/easy-dingtalk -vvv
```

This command installs the Easy DingTalk SDK, which supports PHP 8.1+ and complies with PSR standards.

### 2.2 TypeScript SDK Installation

To install the Magic TypeScript SDK, run:

```bash
npm install @magic/sdk
# or
yarn add @magic/sdk
```

Ensure Node.js is updated to a supported version to avoid runtime issues.

### 2.3 Python SDK Installation

Install the Python SDK via pip:

```bash
pip install magic-sdk
```

If you use virtual environments, activate them before installing.

---

## 3. Verifying Installation

After installation, verify that the SDK is correctly available in your project:

- PHP: Run `composer show dtyq/easy-dingtalk` to confirm installation and check version.
- TypeScript: Run `npm ls @magic/sdk` or `yarn list @magic/sdk`.
- Python: Use `pip show magic-sdk`.

A successful listing confirms the package is installed and ready for integration.

## 4. Quick Project Bootstrap

### 4.1 PHP Example: Easy DingTalk SDK Quickstart

Hereâ€™s a minimal PHP snippet demonstrating how to initialize the Easy DingTalk SDK and fetch an access token.

```php
<?php
use Dtyq\EasyDingTalk\OpenDevFactory;

// Initialize with your DingTalk app credentials
$factory = new OpenDevFactory([
    'app_key' => 'your_app_key',
    'app_secret' => 'your_app_secret',
]);

// Fetch access token to authorize API calls
$accessToken = $factory->getAccessToken();

// Use $accessToken for subsequent requests
```

### 4.2 TypeScript Example: Basic Client Setup

```typescript
import { MagicClient } from '@magic/sdk';

const client = new MagicClient({
  apiKey: 'your_api_key',
});

(async () => {
  const user = await client.getUser();
  console.log(user);
})();
```

### 4.3 Python Example: Quick Start

```python
from magic_sdk import MagicClient

client = MagicClient(api_key='your_api_key')

user = client.get_user()
print(user)
```

---

## 5. Framework Integration

### PHP - Integrating Easy DingTalk SDK with Hyperf Framework

To integrate the Easy DingTalk SDK into a Hyperf PHP project, add the following service definition in your `config/autoload/dependencies.php`:

```php
return [
    Dtyq\EasyDingTalk\OpenDevFactory::class => function (\Psr\Container\ContainerInterface $container) {
        return new Dtyq\EasyDingTalk\OpenDevFactory([
            'app_key' => config('dingtalk.app_key'),
            'app_secret' => config('dingtalk.app_secret'),
        ]);
    },
];
```

This configuration ensures your application can easily instantiate and access the DingTalk SDK factory.

## 6. Common Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Installation Issues">
<Accordion title="Composer Package Not Found or Download Fails">
- Confirm your internet connectivity and access to Packagist.
- Clear Composer cache using `composer clear-cache`.
- Verify Composer version supports PHP 8.1.
- Check for typos in package name.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="SDK Not Recognized in Project">
- Ensure autoloading is correctly configured in your project.
- Run `composer dump-autoload` to regenerate autoload files.
- Confirm namespace and import statements match the SDK's documentation.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Version Conflicts">
- Check for dependency conflicts using `composer why-not dtyq/easy-dingtalk`.
- Upgrade dependent packages to compatible versions.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
