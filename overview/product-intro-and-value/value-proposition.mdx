## Real-World Scenario: Building an AI-Driven Interview Assistant

Imagine you want to rapidly create a recruitment workflow with AI-powered resume screening, candidate evaluation, and interview scheduling:

1. **Start Node:** Initiates the workflow for each new candidate.
2. **Resume Screening (LLM Node):** Automatically analyze and filter resumes based on job requirements.
3. **Capability Extraction (LLM Node):** Extract core competencies, projects, and collaboration skills.
4. **SWOT Analysis (LLM Node):** Assess strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
5. **End Node:** Concludes the process with a summary and next steps.

All nodes are added via Magic’s node templates, enriched with business-specific prompts and connected logically to represent your process — drastically reducing time-to-build and enabling dynamic updates as needed.

## How to Leverage This Page

### Getting Started
- Use this page as a foundation to understand the strategic and practical benefits of Magic.
- Explore example scenarios to inspire your own AI workflow designs.
- Follow links below for deeper technical guides and quickstart tutorials.

### Tips & Best Practices
- Always start with clear business objectives — map critical workflows before adding AI components.
- Use provided node templates as the ground truth for node configurations, ensuring integrity.
- Maintain schema data integrity especially when injecting parameters into complex node templates.
- Keep AI operations transparent — log and monitor for success metrics and iteration.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Avoid modifying node templates by deletion; always merge or extend parameters.
- Never flatten complex schema into a single string; preserve structured property layers.
- Do not omit critical schema fields; each nested property must be complete.
- Beware of skipping validation of node connections or missing dependency nodes.
