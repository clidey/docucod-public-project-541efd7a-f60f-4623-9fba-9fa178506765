# Key Terminology

Welcome to the Magic platform's Key Terminology page. This glossary is your compass to understand the unique technical terms that form the foundation of Magic's architecture and user experience. Clarity here ensures smooth navigation throughout the entire documentation and seamless implementation of solutions.

## Core Terms and Their Significance

### Agent
An _Agent_ is an AI assistant or bot empowered to perform specific tasks within Magic. Agents can communicate, make decisions, invoke tools, and operate autonomously or as part of a workflow.

**Why it matters:** Agents embody AI capability in Magic, enabling intelligent task execution without constant user intervention.

---

### Node
A _Node_ represents a fundamental building block within a Magic workflow. Each node encapsulates a discrete function or operation, such as sending a message, running code, querying knowledge, or invoking an AI model.

**Why it matters:** Nodes let you visually and logically orchestrate complex sequences, making automation intuitive and manageable.

---

### Tool
A _Tool_ is a reusable process or utility that encapsulates specific functionality, often called by agents or nodes. Tools improve modularity by delegating certain tasks outside a workflow's main path.

**Why it matters:** Tools enable code reuse and specialization, reducing redundancy and boosting flow reliability.

---

### Flow (Workflow)
A _Flow_ (sometimes called _workflow_) is a complete automation or orchestration sequence composed of interconnected nodes. Flows represent business logic or AI capabilities constructed through graphical design.

**Why it matters:** Flows allow users to create complex, multi-step automations that drive real-world AI-powered processes.

---

### Workspace
A _Workspace_ is a collaborative environment or container for organizing flows, knowledge bases, agents, and other resources related to a project or domain.

**Why it matters:** Workspaces isolate work contexts, helping teams manage permissions, versions, and resources efficiently.

---

### Knowledge Base
The _Knowledge Base_ holds professional domain knowledge or company-specific data that Magic’s AI can retrieve and reason over. It enhances AI responses’ accuracy and relevance beyond generic large models.

**Why it matters:** Enables Magic to provide context-aware, specialized answers and automations, elevating user experience.

---

### Access Token
An _Access Token_ is a security credential used when calling Magic's APIs or SDKs. It authenticates users and authorizes access with fine-grained permissions.

**Why it matters:** Ensures secure, controlled interaction with Magic’s platform services.

---

### Token
In the context of large language models, a _Token_ is a basic unit of text—such as words, subwords, or characters—that the model processes.

**Why it matters:** Understanding tokens helps in managing input limits and optimizing prompt design.

---

### Prompt
A _Prompt_ is a natural language instruction or context given to AI models to guide output generation.

**Why it matters:** Crafting clear prompts is crucial to get meaningful, targeted AI responses.

---

### Memory
_Memory_ refers to Magic's capability to store, retrieve, and utilize information over the course of conversations or workflows, via variables, databases, or long-term records.

**Why it matters:** Memory enables personalized, context-rich AI interactions and more powerful automations.
